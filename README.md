# Extreme Value Theory (EVT) Application

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth application of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) for modeling and analyzing extreme events within a given dataset. The primary objective is to fit appropriate EVT models to the observed data, enabling robust estimation of extreme quantiles and probabilities of rare events. The analysis distinguishes between Block Maxima and Peaks Over Threshold approaches, applying each where most suitable.

## Key Features & Methodologies

The project comprises the following:

1.  **Block Maxima Approach (GEV Model):**
    * Implementation of the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution for modeling block maxima.
    * Parameter estimation for the GEV distribution.
    * Diagnostic plots (quantile-quantile, probability-probability) to assess model fit.
    * Return level estimation and confidence intervals for various return periods.

2.  **Peaks Over Threshold Approach (GPD Model):**
    * Application of the Peaks Over Threshold methodology using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).
    * Detailed threshold selection process, including mean residual life plots and stability of GPD parameters.
    * Estimation of GPD parameters and assessment of model fit through graphical diagnostics.
    * Derivation of return levels and probabilities of exceedance for high thresholds.

3.  **Model Comparison and Interpretation:**
    * Comparative analysis of results obtained from both GEV and GPD models.
    * Discussion on the implications of the estimated extreme value indices and tail behavior.
    * Quantification of extremal risk, providing insights into potential future extreme events.
